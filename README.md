# Assignment Title: E-commerce Development Task

## Assignment Description:

In this assignment, you will create a basic e-commerce application using Next.js / React.js. You'll apply key React/Next concepts and fundamental web development skills. Your task is to develop a multi-page web application named "OnlineStore" that allows users to browse and search for products.

## Instructions:

1. Fork the provided project repository to your profile and clone it to your machine to begin the project.
2. Design and implement a web application named "OnlineStore" that allows users to browse and search for products.
3. The application should have the following pages:
   - Home Page: Display a list of products with their images, names, and prices. Fetch the list from the provided API endpoint.
   - Search Page: Include a search bar where users can input the name of a product. On form submission, display a list of search results (products) fetched from the API endpoint.
   - Product Details Page: When a user clicks on a product from the search results or product list, they should be redirected to a page that displays detailed information about the product, including the product image, name, price, and description.

You can fetch data using the following API endpoint: https://fakestoreapi.com/

## Requirements:

- Use React.js/Next.js to create the web application.
- Create a visually appealing UI using any CSS framework (like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS).
- Use react query (Tanstack query) for fetching and caching the api data.
- Implement client-side routing to enable smooth transitions between pages.
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Use Git for version control, committing your code regularly to the forked Git repository in your profile.
- Deploy the application to a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) and provide a live demo URL in your repo and the submission form.

### Bonus Points:

- Making use of TypeScript for type safety.
- Use of Next.js is preferred over react
- Use of global state management with Redux toolkit, Recoil or any other state management library.
- Implement a responsive UI to improve user experience on mobile devices.
- Handle loading and error states during data fetching.
- Add a shopping cart functionality where users can add products to the cart and view the cart.
